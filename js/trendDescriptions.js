    inc_loss: "Since COVID-19 began spreading across the US, millions have lost their jobs and filed for unemployment. And many who have kept their jobs have seen cuts in their hours and take home pay. Due to effects of structural racism and occupational segregation, workers of color hold a higher share of vulnerable and lower-paying jobs. As a result, they hold less savings and wealth, suggesting families of color will recover more slowly, if at all, as the COVID-19 crisis continues.",

    food_insufficient: "To have a healthy and adequate diet, families need access to food and income to buy food. But COVID-19 has forced increased restrictions to grocery stores and has caused millions to lose income. Families of color already had higher rates of food insufficiency before the pandemic, the result of lower financial stability and lower access to healthy food perpetuated by structural racism.",
    classes_cancelled: "With most schools nationwide having transitioned to online classes following spring break, families and school districts have needed to adapt to remote learning on short notice. But not all students or school systems have access to the tools and technology needed to engage in online learning, and many schools donâ€™t have the capacity to bridge the gaps.",
    depression_anxiety_signs: "While COVID-19 could potentially infect anyone, posing significant risk to their health, communities of color have borne the brunt of the pandemic, due in part to disparate access to health care, greater risk of exposure, and higher rates of underlying health conditions. For many, public health insurance programs help decrease poverty and connect families to social supports and assistance programs that promote health and wellbeing."
